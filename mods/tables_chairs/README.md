# Tables and Chairs

This mod adds basic functional furniture (Chairs, Stools, Tables, Small Tables, Tiny Tables, Benches) to Minetest Game, Mineclone2 and Mineclonia.

It's a fork of ts_furniture. The eye_height bugs have been fixed, Mineclone support has been added, you no longer sit in air and the nonfunctional disabled by default kneeling bench has been removed and a stool and a bench with backrest has been added.

If you are using ts_furniture and did not place down any kneeling benches, you can replace it with this.

Translation is now easier. Just post the following with the right side in your language and I will add your language.
```
